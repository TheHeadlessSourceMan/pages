# pages

Introduces a file format similar to
.url only you can open a whole set of pages at the same time.

.pages file format
------------------
Each file is simply a list of urls. You can also include the filename of
a url file, another .pages file, an html file, or even a directory of
things to open.

Status:
-------

* Works pretty darned good.

* Registers the format and everything on Windows. (Would still need system
integration for other OSes)

* Knows how to open .pages file in Firefox. Other browser support should
be included.

* There is some experimental dragdrop stuff for adding urls to the file, but it really doesn't work yet.
